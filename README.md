# The-Sound-of-Wine

This experimental project sets out to investigate the different resonating frequencies when the rim of the wine glass containing different volumes of wine is excited/rubbed. The project uses various different technologies to measure the frequency of the resonating wine glasses. One of which is SpectrumView by Oxford Wave Research. The project tackles complicated physical concepts relating to resonance and waves such as the Young's Modulus. After testing various volumes of wine and experimenting with different types of wine glasses, a complicated relationship pertaining to a specific wine glass shape is found and is illustrated using a graph. The relationship compares the square of the ratio of the frequency of the filled wine glass to the frequency of the wine glass while empty (fundamental frequency) vs. the 4th power of the ratio of the height of the liquid compared to the height of the glass. An equation involving constants is then formed and the project concludes successfully.
